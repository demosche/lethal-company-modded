## Extra: other jetpack mods I recommend
- [JetpackWarning by klepticat & Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpackWarning/) - Adds visual and audio indicators for when your jetpack may explode.
- [JetpackFallFix by Hamunii](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hamunii/JetpackFallFix/) - Fixes buggy jetpack fall damage logic, utilizing slight but necessary creative freedom.
