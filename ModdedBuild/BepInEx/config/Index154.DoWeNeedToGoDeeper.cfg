[1. Entrance control activation]

## Default percentage chance for the entrance control systems to activate on any given day. Will make it so by default everyone can only enter through the main entrance and leave through the fire exits. The other modes will override this behavior
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 20
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global activation chance = 20

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom entrance control activation chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. This will override the global chance for the selected moons. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Custom activation chances per moon = 

[2. Dynamic mode]

## Default percentage chance for dynamic mode to activate on any given day where the entrance control systems have already been activated. Will make it so everyone can enter using any door. Each player can then only exit through the type of door they did not enter through. If you teleport into the facility then you can use any door to leave. This mode will take priority over corruption mode
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 50
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global dynamic mode chance = 50

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom dynamic mode chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Custom dynamic mode chances per moon = 

[3. Corruption mode]

## Default percentage chance for corruption mode to activate on any given day where the entrance control systems have already been activated. Will make it so everyone can only enter through a fire exit and leave through the main entrance, basically reversing the default behavior
# Setting type: Int32
# Default value: 10
# Acceptable value range: From 0 to 100
Global corruption chance = 10

## Comma-separated list of moons with custom corruption chances. Example: 'Titan:0,Vow:25,March:90,Dine:5,Gratar:100'. This will override the global chance for the selected moons. Modded moons should also work
# Setting type: String
# Default value: 
Custom corruption chances per moon =

# Setting type: Boolean

## If true, everyone can exit and enter using any door while power in the facility is turned off through the breaker box (or if the moon started with the power turned off)
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Disable entrance controls while the breaker box is turned off = false

## Whether a chat message should be sent when the entrance controls are active (in addition to the alert popup). Can be useful because it doesn't disappear unlike the alert box
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Send status alert in chat = false
