# Malfunctioning Doors Mod

This mod makes doors a little more... Hazardous...

Doors can have a malfunction assigned to it.
Depending on the malfunction, it can behave it creepy or hazardous ways.

Malfunctions will also be different over time.

A normal door will always be a normal door though.

These are all Malfunctions this mod currently adds:

- Open / Close Malfunction (Doors will sometimes refuse to open/close)
- Lock Malfunction (Doors might lock themselves, forcing them to stay open or closed until a key is used)
- Eat Key Malfunction (Doors might eat keys instead of unlocking)
- Explode Malfunction (A ghost hand might push you away and deal damage by doing so. You can just open them and walk
  through, but be careful when they are closed!)
- Random Open / Close Malfunction (Doors will just open and close randomly)

This mod also adds its own version of door breach :)

Shoutout to [**s1ckboy**](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/s1ckboy/) who made the ghost hand model and sfx!
