## What does it do?

Customise it to your liking with a customisable on and off messages!
Just use the keyword "on" or "off" and it auto-colors

Its just a small change but can save you from "accidentally" killing your friends!
This also tells you how much ammo you have in the shotgun!

This includes a config to change the color of the message, this does need lethalconfig OR on thunderstore change it manually!
