## What does it do?

The safety tooltip can be confusing at times.

	The old tooltip:
	
	(When the safety is off) "Turn the safety on: [Q]"
	(When the safety is on) "Turn the safety off: [Q]"
	
	The mods tooltip
	
	(When the safety is off) "The safety is off: [Q]"
	(When the safety is on) "The safety in on: [Q]"

Its just a small change but can save you from "accidentally" killing your friends!

This includes a config to change the color of the message, this does need lethalconfig OR on thunderstore change it manually!
