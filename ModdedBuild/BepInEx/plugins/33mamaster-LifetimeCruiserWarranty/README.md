# LifetimeCruiserWarranty
 The Lifetime Cruiser Warranty mod for Lethal Company.

 This mod aims to treat the cruiser as a ship upgrade instead of an item.

 ## Features
 - Allows all future re-purchasing of the Company Cruiser to be covered by the warranty.
 	- Buy the cruiser once, get it for the rest of the save!
 
 #### Configurable Features
 - Punish players with a credit penalty if the Company Cruiser is destroyed or left behind.
	- This acts very similar to the penalty you recieve from dead crewmates.
	- Default: `Enabled`
