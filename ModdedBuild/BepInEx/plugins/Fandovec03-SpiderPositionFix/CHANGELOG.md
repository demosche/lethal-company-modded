- 1.1.2
	- Fixed debug logger missing condition
- 1.1.1
	- Rewamped how spider moves to wallposition. Spider agent now pathfinds below the wall position before meshcontainer and agent separates
	- Changed formula of how much agent speed is reduced
	- Spider now tilts when moving on slopes
	- Tweaked thresholds
- 1.1.0
	- Fixed idle animation having an offset. Spider is symmetrical.
- 1.0.8
	- Fixed agent moving during stare.
	- Tweaked thresholds
	- Spider movement is less jittery when moving on slopes.
- 1.0.7
	- Agent Jump areaMask is now toggled depending on whenever spider is inside or outside
		- Credit to AudioKnight for reporting the issue
	- Spider now marks a position where it started climbing wall. Agent now uses this to warp to nearest navmesh instead of the spider
		- This fixes an issue agent being teleported to nearest NavMesh regardless if it was behind a wall or not
	- Added Config:
		- Toggle to not modify agent areaMask
		- Toggle for debug logs
- 1.0.6
	- Agent gets slowed down when a distance threshold between agent and container is crossed
	- Rotation no longer snaps when crossing links
	- Spider is slightly slower on links
- 1.0.5
	- rotation patch is not applied when overrideSpiderLookrotation is true
- 1.0.4
	- Instead of interpotating meshContainer position and rotation, the mod now interpolates Target position and rotation of the meshContainer. This results in much more natural movement.
	- Spider looks at the end point of the offMeshLinks when traveling through them for the time being.
- 1.0.3
	- Reverted back to Lerp interpolation
	- Agent now teleports to the nearest navMesh point when the spider crawls off walls.
	- Slightly loosened the tollerance
	- removed static from variables. Spiders no longer affect eachother.
	- Fixed a bug where the patch stopped applying fix after reaching wall possition
- 1.0.2 - Rewrote the code and tightened tolerance further to make movement look better on stairs and staircases <br>
- 1.0.1 - Made tolerance tighter, changed lerp to slerp<br>
- 1.0.0 - Initial release <br>
