## Monster Mechanics (Spoilers ahead!)
<details>
  <summary><strong style="font-size: 1.4em;">Monsters</strong></summary>

- Bruce The Flying Shark : Bruce is a docile outside enemy that likes to spawn during the midday. He only attacks players who are injured near him. The more a player is injured, the further away Bruce will be able to smell them. Only one can spawn at once.

- Mantis Shrimps : Don't let their small size fool you; these little guys pack a punch! Docile, these inside creatures roam around the facility until a player walks too close. Once a player gets too close, they stop moving and warn the player, and if the player persists in their approach... the player becomes history. They spawn in small groups.

- Sea Mines : Nobody knows how they float or how they got there, but all that we know is that the Sea Mines are a new inside hazard. Much like landmines, they explode on touch. However, Sea Mines cannot be jumped over, but can be crouched under. Listen closely to their ghostly beeps, for these pieces of ancient technology cannot be hacked via the terminal or located on the map.

- Urchins : It only takes one to ruin your day. These outside spiky balls damage the player on touch and multiply during the day. Urchins grow over time until they mitosis (split) into two smaller urchins that continue the cycle. They like to spawn at the start of the day in small numbers and then balloon in quantity by the end of the day. However, you can combat this invasive threat with a trusty dose of violence! Give it a whack and eliminate them before it's too late.

- Bell Crab : The Bell Crab is a small crab that hides in Brass Bells, upon picking it up, it will start snipping the player until dropped. When dropped, it will run away and hide again. The Bell Crab can be killed for its scrap.

- HorseShoot Crab : Spring loaded and ready to launch, these flat creatures can be used to launch yourself to many higher up areas. Hitting them cycles between 3 launch powers. They can also be pushed around to move them to your preferred spot.

- ClownHorn Fish : Toot toot! This little clownfish will follow the first player it sees, even able to follow them inside. It will occasionally honk its magical clown horn giving varying buffs and rarely some debuffs. It can be interacted with and Squeezed for a guaranteed boost but it comes at a cost...

- Super scary mode : Terrifying creature that mimics random sound effects and scares the player when looked at.
