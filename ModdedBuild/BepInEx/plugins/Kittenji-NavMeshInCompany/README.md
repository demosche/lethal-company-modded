# NavMesh in Company Building
Enables the use of AI pathfinding and navigation in the Company Building allowing the spawning of Enemies.

> This mod attempts to add Navigation Mesh data to the Company moon.

> It should be used by other mods as a dependency to allow spawning enemies on the company building.


<sup>If for some reason you want to use it as a Soft dependency.</sup><br>
BepInEx Dependency String: `dev.kittenji.NavMeshInCompany`

> NOTE: This mod for some magical reason also fixes Masked Enemies in The Company, therefore the Mask item will actually work.
