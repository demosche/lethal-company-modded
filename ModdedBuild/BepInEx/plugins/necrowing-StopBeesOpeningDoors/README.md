# Stop Bees Opening Doors

According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to open a door... this mod simply makes this a reality!
Quick one-liner mod, made on request from @overzhorman on the [Official Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC).

Note that due to the nature of this mod, it will likely not be updated unless there are breaking bugs; unlikely, they can't even get through the door!
