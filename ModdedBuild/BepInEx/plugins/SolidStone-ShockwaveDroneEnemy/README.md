# Shockwave Drone Mod

## About This Mod
Adds a new drone enemy that randomly wanders the facility.
Everything in this mod should be configurable.
1 Enemy 1 Scrap (drops from the drone when killed).

There is lore inside the terminal to understand why the drone acts like it does.

## AI
The drone cannot see players it will randomly roam and send out a attack randomly every 15 to 60 seconds that damages players in an area around the drone,
This makes encounters with it relatively safe although be careful around it.
