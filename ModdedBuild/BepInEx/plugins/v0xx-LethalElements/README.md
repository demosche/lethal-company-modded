Brace yourself for scorching temperatures that will push your endurance to the limit!

- **Heat Exhaustion**: Extended exposure decreases your stamina and slows its regeneration.
- **Visual Distortion**: Experience realistic heat haze effects that blur your vision.



### Next on: Solar Flare

Beware the unpredictable and disruptive effects of solar radiation!
Solar flares come in four intensities: **Weak**, **Mild**, **Average**, and **Strong**. Each level changes the severity of the following effects:

- Radio Interference: Distorts walkie-talkie communication quality, making team coordination challenging.
- Radar Map Distortion: Causes visual noise and inaccuracies on your radar map screen.
- Teleporter Malfunction: Reduces the precision of ship teleporters, potentially leading to dangerous misplacements.
- Battery Drain: Accelerates the discharge rate of electronic devices.
- Signal Scrambling: Randomly switches letters in messages transmitted with the signal translator, increasing the risk of miscommunication.
- Door Malfunction: (Strong and Average only) Steel doors in facilities become unresponsive to manual controls, randomly opening and closing throughout the day.
- Visual Effects:

    - Daytime: Observe intense solar activity on the sun's surface.
    - Nighttime: Witness breathtaking **auroras** painting the sky in vibrant colors.

**Countermeasures**:
- Activate *radar boosters* to mitigate some of the interference effects.
