Static enemy are boring, so make them walk !

Turrets, landmines and spike traps can now move to make them more dangerous !

You can config the distance, the delay between each movement, and which map hazard is affected

You can config the chance for a map hazard to being able to move, 0% is never 100% is always

You can choose if map hazards are able to detect a player to run into him ! Disabled by default

You enable coil head mod so hazards will stop moving when you look at it, to have a behavior like coil heads you can enable playerDetection !

**Note that only the host configuration is taken !**

For any suggestion or issue feel free to open an issue on [the github project](https://github.com/Wexop/MapHazardsMoves) !
