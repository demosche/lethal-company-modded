# Automatic InventoryFixPlugin

See [InventoryFixPlugin](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/DOkge/InventoryFixPlugin/) for more information.<br>

It's just the mod above, but automatic.<br>

It checks if the `throwingObject` parameter is set to `true` for longer than 1 second.<br>
If so, it sets it to `false` to allow interactions again.

Also fixes a bug where a grabbed object will never get invalidated
