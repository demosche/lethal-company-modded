# <span style="color:LightBlue"> Mysterious Harbingers
 Void like creatures roam the facilities, searching, but for what?

Heavily inspired by the Harbingers from Path of Exile.

## Overview
Adds A new Monster to the facilities that tends to wonder aimlessly. It doesn't seem hostile, but the same cannot be said about his friends.

Log entry:

+ "What strange creatures, if they even can be considered as such. They don't appear to be home to the planets they visit but seem to know where all lifeforms on it are at all times. Whether out of curiosity or something else, they tend to stay close to humans while otherwise wondering aimlessly. Their ability to teleport may have been what brought them here. They seem to pop out of nowhere but are themselves harmless. What isn't so harmless is their ability to teleport others. Let's just hope they can't teleport anything worse. As an additional note, they can teleport us too. "
+ Addendum recording 1:

    Employee 1: "Ah, there we are." 

    Employee 2: "Maybe we should wait with that, we still have time to find more stuff."

    Employee 1: "Yeah, just make sure to mark the path on the way back"

    [Warping sound]

    Employee 1: "What is that! It's making a run for the device"

    [Radiation warning]

    Employee 2: "Where did it go! Get over here you stupid space..."

    [Metallic impact sound]

    Employee 1: "[Employee 2] where did you go! What happened! [Employee 2]?"

    *End of recording*

Exact Info:
+ The harbingers will spawn like any other creature in the facility. They wander aimlessly around the area while waiting for their teleport to come off cooldown (20 seconds).
+ Once ready it will either teleport themselves to a random player in the facility or find a random monster to teleport to the player depending on how close they are to the players and if the cooldown has expired (10 seconds). 
+ Players can also step into the teleportation circle and be teleported to the previous location of the monster that was just teleported. Would you rather stay and face whatever is about to arrive or be sent somewhere unknown to find your way back. 
+ Hitting the harbinger will teleport you to a random enemy or the furthest point from the entrence if no enemy is found.
+ They also interfere with the vision of the monitor making it hard to see enemies and loot near them. 
+ When a harbinger gets close to the Apparatus it will run to it and teleport it to a random location in the facility.
