# True darkness client

Do you want to be on the dark but diversity is too much for your modpack? then this is for you!  
This mod literally just makes sure that when it's dark, it's actually dark, crazy right?  
  
This is the client version it means that you can use it in a lobby without having anyone else being required to have this mod.
