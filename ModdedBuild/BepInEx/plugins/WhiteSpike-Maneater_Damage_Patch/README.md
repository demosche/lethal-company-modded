# Maneater Damage Patch
A mod which patches the maneater's behaviour to take account the amount of force rather than always considering it as one point of damage always.

# How to access the content of the mod
- Without the mod, if you attempt to shoot the adult maneater with a shotgun, it will take five shots to kill it.
- With the mod, if you do the same thing, it will take one shot.
- The baby maneater will always not take damage and instead increase its growth to an adult whenever hit by something.
