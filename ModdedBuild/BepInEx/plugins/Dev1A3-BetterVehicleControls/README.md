### Information

This mod improves the experience of using the Company Cruiser to make it more user friendly:

- Configuration Options
  - Automatic Gearbox
    - Should the gear automatically switch between drive & reverse when pressing the forward/backwards buttons?
  - Automatic Handbrake Release
    - Should the gear automatically switch to drive/reverse from parked? This allows the vanilla behaviour of it exploding when trying to drive whilst in the park gear.
  - Automatic Handbrake Pull
    - Should the gear automatically switch to parked when the key is taken from the ignition?
  - Automatically Center Wheel
    - Should the wheels be automatically centered when the left/right buttons aren't pressed?
  - Center Wheel Speed
    - How fast should the wheel be re-centered? (Instant: 0, Vanilla: -1)
  - Ignition Chance
    - What should the success chance for the ignition be? If set to 0 this will increase the chance each time the ignition is used. (Vanilla: 0)
  - Turbo Boosts
    - How many turbo boosts should you be able to have queued up at the same time? (Vanilla: 5)
- Customisable Keybinds (via the keybind settings in the pause menu)
  - Vehicle Movement
  - Jump/Boost
    - This is the same as the vanilla - if you have any boost available then it boosts otherwise it jumps.
  - Jump
    - This allows you to jump even when you have boosts available.
  - Switching Gears
  - Manually Center Wheel
  - Headlights
  - Horn
  - Windscreen Wipers
  - Toggle Magnet
- Fixes
  - Fixed steering wheel visually desyncing from the actual steering angle.

**NOTE: The "Gas Pedal" keybind overrides the "Drive Forward/Backward" keybinds (if bound to the same key) so if the mod doesn't seem to work properly, make sure that the "Gas Pedal" keybind isn't bound to the same key as "Drive Forward/Backward"!**

### Vanilla Controls

Want to keep the controls the same as vanilla? Well here is a screenshot of what the vanilla controls would be equivalent to:
