Runtime Icons brings a much-needed update to your hotbar! Enjoy breathtakingly-rendered scrap! With patent-pending technology your suit will scan each item you pick up and place its image on your hotbar so you know what to drop when that friendly neighborhood thumper rolls around the corner!

9/10 employees agree that with Runtime Icons, your productivity goes up up up, and you leave less blood on company scrap, which makes the Company happy!


## How it works

The first time an item that lacks an icon is spawned, it generates an icon to replace the gear icon in the HUD. These items are placed into the correct orientation (which can be overridden in the config) to properly display an image in the player's hotbar. This means any modded scrap should be compatible! Additional options are provided in the config.

**Note:** Modded scrap may not render if it has not been built correctly. Modders should refer to the [Mod Developer Information](#mod-developer-information) section.

## Config

The following options are provided:

- **Blacklist/whitelist items** - Select whether to blacklist or whitelist items, then create a list of items to use.
- **Adjust icon emptiness threshold** - Specify the amount of fully transparent pixels allowed before the icon is considered empty.
- **Dump sprites to disk** - This option can be used to collect all generated icons in the `BepInEx/cache` folder. They will be stored in both PNG and EXR, where EXR fully retains specular highlights on transparent objects.

### My custom item is displayed at a weird angle!

You may want to adjust your resting rotation to get a better result. Items will normally be rendered from an angle similar to the perspective of a player that has dropped the item in front of them and then stood back and crouched. This angle will be adjusted somewhat based on the item's dimensions to give the image more depth.

**Note:** Only the X and Z values of the `restingRotation` vector of an item are used. To adjust the Y rotation, the `floorYOffset` should be used instead.
