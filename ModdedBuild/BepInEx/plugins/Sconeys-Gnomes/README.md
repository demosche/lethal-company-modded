Have you ever REALLY wanted to have gnomes in Lethal Company? No? That's okay, here they are anyway!
# Gnomes!
This mod features TWO completely custom AI, with their own rules and methods of being dealt with! While not technically "hostile" I don't know if I'd wanna get too close to one...

Gnomes don't want you to know they're alive (BUT THEY TOTALLY ARE!) so they'll only move when you're not looking! I'm not crazy, you're crazy. But seriously, don't get touched by one...WHO KNOWS where you OR THE GNOME will end up??

# Current Features:
TWO(2) Gnome Enemies. 
	- The Red Gnome.
		- Will only move when not being looked at.
	- The Blue Gnome.
		- Once seen will chase the player.
One (1) Gnome Item! (still an enemy)
