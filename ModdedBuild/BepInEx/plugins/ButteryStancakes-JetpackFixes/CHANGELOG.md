# v1.4.0
- Added config setting to control when the jetpack explodes in mid-air from high speeds
  - Can be turned off completely
  - Can be enabled only at certain heights (new default, like "BecomeFirework" from v1.2)
  - Can be enabled always (like vanilla)
- Fixed several interactions between tulip snakes and jetpacks
  - Now tulip snakes flapping their wings won't spontaneously disable the jetpack
  - Tulip snakes will continue to move you if you turn the jetpack off while they are still flapping
- Added config setting that allows launching yourself by dropping the jetpack mid-flight.
