# Chameleon

Aesthetic changes to make moon environments feel more cohesive, featuring adjustments for both interiors and exteriors.

This mod is designed to work with vanilla moons right out of the box, and there is extremely limited automatic support for some features on modded moons. Further customization options for modded moons are *not guaranteed*, but planned to expand in the future.

All features are enabled by default but can be disabled in the config.

# Features

## Exterior

- `FancyEntranceDoors` - Replaces the main entrance doors with the fancy variant when a manor interior generates.
- `RecolorRandomRocks` - Randomly generated boulders (on the surface) will be snow white on blizzard moons.
- `RainyMarch` - March will experience near-constant drizzling rain, just like the terminal says. (Does not affect quicksand generation)
- `StormyGordion` - Gordion will experience near-constant heavy rain, as in the terminal. (Lightning does not strike at The Company)
  - Choose from `Never`, `Chance`, or `Always`.
  - The specific chance is dynamic and non-configurable.

## Interior

- `DoorLightColors` - The light shining behind the entrance doors (on factory and mineshaft) will change color depending on the current moon and weather conditions.
- `IceCaves` - Mineshaft caverns will be made of ice on blizzard moons. (Rend and Dine; automatic compatibility with modded moons)
- `AmethystCave` - Mineshaft caverns will be made of amethyst on Embrion.
- `DesertCaves` - Mineshaft caverns will be made of red sandstone on Assurance and Offense.
- `MesaCave` - Mineshaft caverns will be made of mauve rock on Experimentation and Titan.
- `IcyTitan` - Mineshaft caverns will be made of ice on Titan instead. (As in earlier versions of the mod)
- `AdaptiveArtifice` - If you use [Artifice Blizzard](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/ArtificeBlizzard/), this will adapt the cave type to match whatever is on the surface. If this is disabled Artifice will always use vanilla caverns.
