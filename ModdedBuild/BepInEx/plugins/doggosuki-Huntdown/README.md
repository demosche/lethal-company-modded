# Huntdown

### Only the host needs this mod for it to work!

Each time you go to a moon, a mission is given to hunt down a specific monster which drops a difficulty dependent reward when hunted. Almost everything is configurable. A config file is generated after you first open the game with the mod installed.

Please note that if you get a mission to hunt down a creature, it is referring to one specific creature within the facility rather than any of that type. For example, if you are tasked with hunting down a Thumper, and there are two Thumpers within the facility, only one of them is your target.

Your mission will be displayed to all members of your team in the chat once you go to a moon where enemies can spawn. The host can use the terminal command 'target' to get a reminder of what they are hunting.
