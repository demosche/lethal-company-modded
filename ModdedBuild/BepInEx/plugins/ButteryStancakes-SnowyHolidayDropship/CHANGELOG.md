# v1.1.1
- Emergency hotfix to make the mod work in v69 again
  - This will prevent modded dropship music from playing on certain moons (such as [Mycordytum](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Ssencipe/Overhaul_Moons/)) for now
  - If this is a dealbreaker, rollback to v1.1.0, just be aware that this means the normal dropship won't appear on vanilla moons
# v1.1.0
- v55 support
# v1.0.4
- [Artifice Blizzard](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/ArtificeBlizzard/) compatibility
# v1.0.3
- Fixed a problem that caused the old music to not be audible at long distances
# v1.0.2
- Fixed multiplayer sync (RNG seed should match between players now, for real)
- Default music is now re-cached at the start of each new day (for better compatibility with modded dropship music)
# v1.0.1
- Increased the volume of the old music
- You can now hear the old music while inside the building (like the other tracks)
- Better error handling for modded moons(?)
