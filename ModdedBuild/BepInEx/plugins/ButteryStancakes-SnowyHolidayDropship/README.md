# Snowy Holiday Dropship
By default, this mod makes the dropship use the holiday music and appearance (from v45 and v69) on snowy moons only. (Rend, Dine, Titan)

Also includes some configuration settings:
- Random chance to use the holiday dropship on normal moons (default is 0%)
- Random chance to use the holiday dropship on the snowy moons (default is 100%)
- Random chance to use the old ice cream music for the normal dropship, from an early teaser video (default is 0%)

The dropship's appearance/music should sync between all clients, as long as you are all using the same settings, but there won't be any gamebreaking issues if you use different configs. (Just cosmetic desync)
