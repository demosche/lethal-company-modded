## Audible Hydraulics

_All players need to have this mod installed with the exact same config settings._

Makes the opening and closing of the hangar ship doors audible to enemies (such as Eyeless Dogs), causing them to investigate and/or attack the source of the noise. The range of this interaction can be configured.

This does not alter any enemy behavior, it only makes the doors register as audible so enemies that are programmed to respond to sound (i.e. Eyeless Dogs) will hear them.

Meant to be used as a balancing feature alongside mods that change ship door behavior, such as:

- [ShipDoorAlwaysCharged](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/boring/ShipDoorAlwaysCharged/) (make the hydraulics last forever)
- [BetterShipDoors](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ViViKo/BetterShipDoors/) (makes the hydraulics last 5x longer, configurable)
- [OuterDoorButtons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CTNOriginals/OuterDoorButtons/) (highly recommended if using either of the above)
- [MonitorDoorButtons](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/CTNOriginals/MonitorDoorButtons/) (can theoretically be used as counterplay to lure dogs back outside)

This is my first mod. If something is broken, you are encouraged to find me on Discord and scold me for my failures.

Thanks to the folks in the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC), but especially [@IAmBatby](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/IAmBatby/), for their patience in helping me grasp some of the basics.
