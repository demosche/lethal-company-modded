MORE NOTE: As of v1.5.0 The bundle has been changed to support v50, this likely means (if not now then in future updates) that MoreEmotes support isn't verified and may not work.

## Issues (incompatiblities)

LCVR compatibility is done by enabling `disableSelfEmote` for anyone who has VR automatically. It can also be manually enabled if you encounter conflicting mods.

There are config options to disable the speed changing and self emoting, these automatically get turned on when there is a known mod that isn't compatible present. But they can be turned on in the config if needed.

Any other issues feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/KlutzyBubbles/lc-better-emotes/issues/new) or contact me directly via the [Lethal Company Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/XeyYqRdRGC) or PM `@KlutzyBubbles` always trying to make sure the mod is as stable as possible.

## Information

v1.4.x Adds a lot of config options, but the old file should still be compatible

Modification of https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Sligili/More_Emotes/

- Some small behind the scenes changes to how things are implemented to make mod compatibility better (maybe probably, in certain scenarios, but it isnt magic)
- Adds VR support. Players without VR can continue flipping off their friends for having VR.
- Adds controller support. With rebinding :)
- Moves keybindings into the settings page, still has config values for defaults for modpacks
- Makes center of emote wheel not change emote (and option to make the outside of the wheel stop the emote)
- Adds config values to alter change emote cooldown and griddy/prisyadka move speed
- Remove the carrying scrap check to make emoting with one hand possible again (its fun)

- Any change suggestions or bugs you can submit an issue or contact directly :)

## NOTE ON CONTROLLERS!!! IMPORTANT (Probably)

There is a binding in game called 'Emote Wheel CONTROLLER ONLY', this should only ever be bound to right or left stick. Binding it to anything else will just default to right stick.
