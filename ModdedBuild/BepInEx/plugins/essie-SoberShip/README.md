# SoberShip
~~Fixes a bug in the game that causes Vain Shrouds to spawn on the ship.~~<br>
Brings back the Vain Shrouds (and the fox) in v60! <br>
Also fixes old saves that still have Vain Shrouds on the ship.

## Features
* Tested to work with v61.
* Server-Side (Only the host needs the mod installed for it to work!)
* Un-Disables the Vain Shrouds (enabled by default).
* Relocates the Vain Shroud spawn position to somewhere away from the ship, if it's too close. (enabled by default)
* Removes existing/spreading Vain Shrouds that are too close to the ship (enabled by default)
* Cap Vain Shroud iterations (enabled by default)
* The option to disable Vain Shrouds completely, which also disables the fox (disabled by default)

All features are configurable and can be tweaked or disabled.<br>
This mod works with [Lethal Config](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) and does not require a restart to apply any config changes.<br>
Proper support for Lethal Config is planned.

If you find a bug or have a suggestion feel free to open an issue on this mods [GitHub page](https://github.com/EssieFir/SoberShip/issues).
