# Lethal Doors
Transforms the hangar doors into a hazardous obstacle or helpful tool when your team is low on scrap on the last day! 

#### Watch this super cool video on the Mod that I worked hard on & would like you to watch :)

## How it Works
- Lethal Hangar Doors: **Shortly after the ship lands,** the hangar doors become deadly. If players are within a dangerous threshold of the door while closing they are either severely injury or terminated.
- Tracks the players affected in each door open/close cycle to ensure damage is applied correctly and fairly.
- Door will not impact player until seconds after the ship lands. This "feature" is considered the safe zone period. Once ship lands it will be lethal. 
- **Requirements**: Both Host & Clients Require Installing the Mod.
