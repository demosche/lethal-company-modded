# Vent Spawn Fix
On its own, this mod does nothing. This just adds support for indoor enemies to spawn in groups of 2 or more, similar to baboon hawks (outside) and tulip snakes (daytime).

This was previously used by the Barber (which was meant to spawn in pairs in v55), but in v62+ Barbers are configured to spawn alone.

This mod is meant to be paired with [BarberFixes](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ButteryStancakes/BarberFixes/) using the `SpawnInPairs` config setting, but it will also work with any content variable customizer, such as [LethalQuantities](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BananaPuncher714/LethalQuantities/) or similar.
