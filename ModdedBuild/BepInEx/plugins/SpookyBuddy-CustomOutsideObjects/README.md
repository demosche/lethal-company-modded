# Custom Outside Objects

Tired of the same rocks and trees being the only random outside objects? Why not add in some new ones! This mod both adds in 6 new objects besides the generic rocks and trees, as well as a system to add in your own objects! Custom destructible script allows for objects besides trees to be destroyed. Config for objects exclusive to moons that match the object's tags.

Works on Custom Moons! If you're having issues getting them object to spawn on Custom Moons, double check your spelling in the Config. The log will print off the Moon's name when landing too, as well as what objects can spawn. If they still are not spawning, the Tags may not match the environment's.
