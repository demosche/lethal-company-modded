# Lethal Doors
Transforms the hangar doors into a hazardous obstacle or helpful tool when your team is low on scrap on the last day!\
Original mod: https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/saint_kendrick/Lethal_Doors/

## How it Works
- Lethal Hangar Doors: **Shortly after the ship lands,** the hangar doors become deadly. If players are within a dangerous threshold of the door while closing they are either severely injury or terminated.
- Tracks the players affected in each door open/close cycle to ensure damage is applied correctly and fairly.
- Door will not impact player until seconds after the ship lands. This "feature" is considered the safe zone period. Once ship lands it will be lethal. 

## Versions & Notes
- 1.0.9 Reverted a change made in 1.0.8.
- 1.0.8 Potential fix for lag when the ship lands on or leaves the moon + The damage caused by the ship's doors should be more reliable for both players and enemies.
- 1.0.7 Doors are more reliable at killing enemies + Desyc issues fixed (hopefully).
- 1.0.6 The original mod has been recompiled and possibly optimized.
- 1.0.5 Now the mod works with V50 of the game.
