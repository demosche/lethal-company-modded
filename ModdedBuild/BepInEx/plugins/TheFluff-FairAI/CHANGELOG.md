# 1.3.5
Removed alpha turret targeting code which produced an error. No problems now.

# 1.3.4
Updated for V.50

# 1.3.3
I temporarily disabled the ability to allow the turret to target enemies because of people disliking the fact I have to override the turret ai and other issues. Enemies can still be enabled to be damaged by turrets.

# 1.3.2
You can now configure to check for players before allowing enemies to be effected by the mod.

# 1.3.1
The issue of mobs not dying properly should now be fixed.

# 1.3.0 
Want a funny little headcrab but with all mobs. Go back a version otherwise this should fix that issue lol.

# 1.2.9
I added a basic targeting support for enemies now. Feedback  is always welcome.

# 1.2.8
Fixed for new version of Lethal Company. 

# 1.2.7
Probably Fixed Sync Error With Turret And Enemy Deaths And Damage.

# 1.2.6
