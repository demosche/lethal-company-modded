# Weed Killer Fixes
Fixes bugs with weed killer:
- Fixed spray collision so it can detect vain shrouds that grow inside walls, terrain, under the ship, etc.
- Fixed the broken cooldown for adding HP/turbo to the Cruiser, which caused most of your sprays to be wasted. You should consistently get results each spray now
- Fixed a Cruiser softlock where weed killer improperly detected certain colliders on the truck as weeds, shrinking them and causing it to get stuck inside the ship when you turn on the magnet.
