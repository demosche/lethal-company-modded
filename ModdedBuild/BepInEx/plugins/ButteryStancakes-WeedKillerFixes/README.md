# Weed Killer Fixes
Fixes bugs with weed killer:
- Fixed vain shrouds ignoring weed killer as of the v60 update. (Only applies to old save files, or [YesFox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Dev1A3/YesFox/))
- Fixed the broken cooldown for adding HP/turbo to the Cruiser, which caused most of your sprays to be wasted. You should consistently get results each spray now
- Fixed spray collision so it can detect vain shrouds that grow inside walls, terrain, under the ship, etc.
- Fixed lag spikes
  - When weeds get destroyed
  - When spraying the Cruiser
