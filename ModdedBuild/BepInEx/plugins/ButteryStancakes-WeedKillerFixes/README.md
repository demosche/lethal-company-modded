# Weed Killer Fixes
Fixes bugs with weed killer:
- Fixed vain shrouds ignoring weed killer as of the v60 update. (Only applies to old save files, or if you use mods to re-enable vain shrouds)
- Fixed spray collision so it can detect vain shrouds that grow inside walls, terrain, under the ship, etc.
- Fixed the broken cooldown for adding HP/turbo to the Cruiser, which caused most of your sprays to be wasted. You should consistently get results each spray now
