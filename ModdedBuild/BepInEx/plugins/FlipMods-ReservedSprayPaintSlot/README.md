# ReservedSprayPaintSlot
**Requires: [ReservedItemSlotCore](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ReservedItemSlotCore/)**

This mod gives a dedicated item slot for spraypaint cans!<br>
This slot can be purchased at the terminal unless disabled by the ReservedItemSlotCore mod in the config.

These item slots are aligned on the right side of the screen, and stack vertically with other ReservedItemSlot mods.

You cannot switch to these slots manually by scrolling. Instead, the method for swapping to these items is to hold Alt, and scrolling up and down to switch between them.<br>
This way, you can swap to these items to drop them, as well as other actions, such as charging, storing, etc.

The spraypaint sits nicely, holstered on your waist, when not in your hand.<br>
This item will also be seen on Masked Enemies if they are mimicking your character, and you have this item equipped.

This mod also adds (optional) quality of life tweaks to the spraypaint, such as extended capacity, longer spray time, longer spray distance, etc.<br>
Currently, only the extended capcity is implemented, and set to 10x, but editable in the config. This setting does not sync yet, but this will be implemented in the future!<br><br>

## Item Slot is Purchasable! (new in 1.1.0)
+ The spraypaint slot can now be purchased from the terminal, unless this option is disabled in the ReservedItemSlotCore config.
+ Purchased slots will sync with all players, and be linked the the game's save. This means reloading a game in progress *should* reload this unlocked slot.
+ Slots will not display until the game as been started by the host.<br><br>

## Configurable
+ Now adds more config options!
+ Item slot price can be adjusted in the config.
+ Item slot priority can be adjusted in the config.
+ Items can be added to this item slot in the config. This can be handy when adding other modded items, or variations of this item, to this item slot.<br>
You can also add the translated names of items to this slot so it should be more compatible between different languages.<br><br>
