# Shovel Fix

Attempts to fix the fact that shovels tend to hit a wall or doorway next to you rather than what is directly in front of you <br/>

## Installation
### Manual (Not Recommended)
- Place the .dll into the Plugins folder in the [BepInEx](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack/) mod
- Make sure you have [HookGenPatcher](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Evaisa/HookGenPatcher/) installed as well in the same folder
<br/><br/>

### Auto (Recommended)
- Install using [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/) by just downloading through that. Dependencies will install.

## Notes
This is just an attempt and I will try to fix it if the needs arise. I can be found on Discord in appropriate channels as well as on the GitHub repo for this mod.
