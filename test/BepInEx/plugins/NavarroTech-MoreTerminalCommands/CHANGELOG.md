# Changelog
## 1.0.2
FIXES:
- Fixed a bug that wasn't locking the door
- Added an alternate command "door" to also toggle open/close the door
## 1.0.1
NEW COMMANDS:
- "shipdoor" => Toggle the shipdoor open and closed.
- "lockdoor" => Locks the shipdoor so the hydraulic won't decrease (make sure you unlock it before you inverse teleport away!)
- "unlockdoor" => Unlocks the shipdoor
- "greatasset" => Plays the great asset intro :)
- "scotty" => Will also now teleport the chosen player (Star Trek reference hehe)
CHANGED COMMANDS:
- Changed "inverse" to "iteleport", as it was making it hard to buy the inverse teleport when you typed "buy inverse"
- Also added "itp" to inverse teleport faster.
## 1.0.0
